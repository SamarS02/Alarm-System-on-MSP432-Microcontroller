# Alarm-System-on-MSP432-Microcontroller
This is an alarm system created using the MSP 432 microcontroller, a breadboard, 3 switches, a 470 Ohm resistor, and a red LED.
The first switch is used as an activation switch to prime the alarm system.
The second and third switches are used to detect if one of the two or both of the windows were pried open after the alarm has been set.
Once the alarm is on and any one of the window sensors are activated, then the red LED will flash at a rate of 5Hz to indicate an intruder.
